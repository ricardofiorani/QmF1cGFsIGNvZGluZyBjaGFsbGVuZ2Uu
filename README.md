# Installation:

1 - To start the express backend server on the port 3000 run:
```bash
yarn local:watch
```

2 - To start the Postgres database on the port 5432 run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

3 - Manually create the database "test" in the PG Admin (http://localhost:5050/ password: admin) before running:
`ts-node src/setUpDatabase.ts` to sync/create the tables.

# Endpoints
## GET form structure
http://localhost:3000/forms/structure/userForm

## POST insert form data
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3000/forms/userForm' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "data": {
        "id": "123456",
        "address": {
            "street": "123 Main St",
            "city": "Anytown"
        },
        "customer": {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "johndoe@example.com"

# Todos
There are many things left for improvement, but I tried to keep it simple and focus on the main points.
Ideally this project would have test coverage (unit and integration), linting, the express process would run inside docker, etc...

# Overall explanation
As one of the requirements is `keep in mind that this system needs to be built for scale` I decided to opt here for the hexagonal architecture.
This means, today the endpoints works with Express and Postgres, but in the future we could easily change the framework or the database without affecting the core business logic.
